  <h3 align="center">C - Simple Shell</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Our Simple Shell is a command line program that allows the user to execute commands. The shell is started by opening a terminal and displays a prompt where the user can enter commands. In addition to executing built-in commands, such as "cd" and "exit", it can also execute external commands by providing the full path to the executable file. It is written in C programming language and can be compiled and run on Linux operating systems.

<h2 align="center">About The Project</h2>

<p align="center">The Simple Shell is a project that aims to create a basic command line interface for interacting with the operating system. 
  The purpose of the project was to understand how the interaction between a user and the operating system works. Also, to add custom functions that an original shell would'nt have.</p>
